This repository contains a Python converter class designed to facilitate the conversion of annotation files from various formats to the Bina COCO (Common Objects in Context) annotation format.
The converter class accepts a zip file containing datasets and walks through it, extracting annotation files and transforming them into the specified Bina COCO format.

Features:

Supports conversion of annotation files from various formats to Bina COCO format.
Handles zip file input, making it easy to process datasets stored in this format.
Simplifies the conversion process, allowing users to quickly adapt their annotation files to the Bina COCO standard.
Usage:

Provide a zip file containing datasets with annotation files.
Instantiate the converter class and specify the input and output paths.
Run the conversion process, which will extract annotation files from the zip and convert them to Bina COCO format.
Access the converted annotation files for further use in computer vision projects.
This converter class streamlines the annotation preprocessing pipeline, enabling seamless integration of datasets annotated in different formats into projects utilizing the Bina COCO annotation standard."
